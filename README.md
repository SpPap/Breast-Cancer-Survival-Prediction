## Aim of the project
This repository is a part of a university semester project in Biomedical Technology course. The project aims to use machine learning techniques in medical data and acquire useful information. In our project, we used a Kaggle dataset containing information about patients with breast cancer and based on different aspects we built 2 classifiers to predict the chance of survival. The scikit-learn library was used for the ML models as long as numpy, pandas and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization purposes.

Classification models trained
- Non-Linear SVM 
- Decision Tree

Files available
- Dataset in excel file
- Dataset in XML format
- Jupyter notebook containing Python code 

Dataset is available in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amandam1/breastcancerdataset
